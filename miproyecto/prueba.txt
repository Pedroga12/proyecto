Esta es una linea nueva, pero igual tiene que quedar solo la palabra que cambio

Hola Mundo!

Uh, caught up in the whip, Mary Jane all up in my head
Upside down when I took the mask off
Pull the mask back down, time to ride out right now
You was mine then (You was mine then)
And you mine now (And you mine now)
Show me where they hide (Show me where they hide)
And let me find out (Let me find out)
Ball hog and I'm balled out
And we go all out, down to no doubt
Yeah, nose bleeds, sell the floors out
Caught up in the web, tell 'em, "Log out" (Mwah)
Kisses, baby, I bossed up, go frisk us, baby
Won't you be my missus, baby?
Ven aqu√≠, I miss it, baby (Uh)
Get liftin', I can tell you gifted, baby
Necklace like Saint Nicholas, baby
Wrap it up like Christmas, baby, uh
